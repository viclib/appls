Some tools to aid the creation of web-apps using LiveScript. 
Simply program your site/game using ls and convert it to a working HTML5 app.

Install:

    npm install appls -g

Usage:

    appls my_file.ls

This generates `my_file.html`, which is a fully featured HTML5 app. 
See /test for examples.
